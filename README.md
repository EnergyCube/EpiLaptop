`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EnergyCube/EpiLaptop/main/epilaptop.sh && chmod +x`

### Step 2 🏁 (Run)
You can run EpiLaptop with `./epilaptop.sh` if you are in the folder where the epilaptop.sh file is located (or just run `epilaptop` from anywhere if you follow Step 2)

### Step 3 📥 (Register Script) [Optional]
Register epilaptop as a command in your system
`sudo mv epilaptop.sh /usr/bin/epilaptop`

📖 Notes
-------
No need to update the script! It checks and installs itself if needed the updates of the script !
This script has been write and tested for Fedora 32 EPITECH (Tek1) release but it should work on any machine as long as it's a Fedora System
<br/>EPITECH's Default Applications (like Teams) can install themselves if they are not.
